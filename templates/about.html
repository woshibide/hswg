        A vineyard exists in the city. The land was empty, now it holds rows of vines. The grapes grow, then they are taken. They can be made into wine, or they can be eaten. The choice belongs to the one who tends them.
        Seasons pass. The vineyard remains. People arrive, they work, they leave. Some press the grapes, some watch. Some speak, some do not. The wine is poured, the bottle is emptied. The cycle begins again.
        To join is to take part. To take part is to grow, to prune, to harvest. The work is done in silence or in speech. A certificate is given. A task is completed. The vineyard remains.
